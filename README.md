# Snake-Gameüêç

Hola! 

We all have childhood memories of playing this game for hours on the one and only phone-Nokia 3310üì±

This is a similar recreation of the game!

You press "up" , "down", "left", "right" to maneuver the snake.

If the snake is facing up and you press "down" the snake cannot change it's directory, this is vice-versa and also for left and right.

The food randomly spawns on the screen.
Each time you eat food the length of the snake increases.

If you crash on the border of the screen, You die, Game Over.

If the snake head collides with any part of the body, you die, Game Over.

You see your high score once you have start playing the game.

Don't worry your highscore will always be saved even if you close the program and rerun it. Your high score will be there!

I have attached the screenshots of the game in the folder ScreenShots.
